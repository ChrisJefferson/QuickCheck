  [33X[0;0YQuickCheck  is  a  property-based testing package for GAP that automatically
  validates  functions  against  randomly  generated  inputs.  The package can
  either  verify that a function consistently returns 'true' across inputs, or
  confirm that two functions produce identical results for the same inputs.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  strength  of  QuickCheck  lies in its ability to rapidly test functions
  with  diverse  inputs,  including  edge  cases  that are often overlooked in
  manual  testing, such as empty lists, trivial groups, or boundary values. By
  generating  hundreds  of test cases automatically, QuickCheck helps discover
  bugs  and inconsistencies that might not be apparent from inspecting code or
  writing traditional tests.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis approach is particularly valuable for mathematical algorithms and group
  theory implementations where exhaustive testing is impractical.[133X
